The trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what a programmer is doing until it’s too late. (Seymour Cray) For a long time it puzzled me how something so expensive, so leading edge, could be so useless. And then it occurred to me that a computer is a stupid machine with the ability to do incredibly smart things, while computer programmers are smart people with the ability to do incredibly stupid things. They are, in short, a perfect match. (Bill Bryson) The Web is like a dominatrix. Everywhere I turn, I see little buttons ordering me to Submit. (Nytwind) Never trust a computer you can’t throw out a window. (Steve Wozniak)
